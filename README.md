This program assists an user to quickly read pasted-in text. Distracting punctuation
is removed and highlighting is added to help the eye focus. The speed of playback and size
of the text are also easily adjusted.

This version uses React and Babel along with ES6 syntax. To use, simply clone and open
`superreader.html` in a browser. Alternatively, a live page is available [here](https://ebersole.tech/superreader/superreader.html).
